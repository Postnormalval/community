Valerie D.H is a tenzo (the cook of the community in zen tradition)  and the co-founder of the Bergerac Praxis Hub at Life Itself.  

For the second time at the Hub she curated a Meditation - Fermentation miso retreat and a food workshop dedicated to the cooks 2.0. 

Here are some thoughts collected from Valerie D.H after her retreat and workshops. 

When I asked her what they did during this food events she answered, “The intention of this format (retreat + workshop) was to give visibility to the mirroring effect of the complexity of the world in our food production system and within ourselves.”

She explains that, “When we prepare food or talk about it, it is not about food. We can see the whole cycle of life through the fermentation process, particularly the evolutionary process coming from the death - life endless circularity and reconnect to what to be human deeply feels.”

The Miso retreat took place during three days focused on exploring the deconstruction process of being fermented by life. The food workshop was dedicated to exploring the posture of the cook and how to deal with the complex issues of our world by allowing them to be manifested in the kitchen or during meals through a disposition of receptivity to what is. 

During a moving debate participants could explore the complexity of our food system, building new capacities to talk about it and expand what food really means in a time of transition when good and bad are not clear anymore. 

One of the main intentions of the workshop was to give an opportunity for cooks to share how they each could contribute to the current crisis, through their posture and capacity to share a different sense of nourishment. 

Valerie concludes, “to deconstruct the sense of not having enough in the context of food insecurity can contribute to the peace we need in chaos and this is  what cooks can offer .

## Next food residency

The context of metacrisis is urging us to pause. Cooks have a role to play that Valerie wants to share with, so if you are cooking for groups, communities or if you are interested to do so please join for the next food residency to practice how to cook in a manner that can help to ease fear of change. 

### June residency: How to nourish the world today?

In the same manner as the 2 previous editions, this residency would start by deepening the question internally with a 3 days retreat where we would practice O ryoki (the practice of being nourished by what is) and listen deeply to the heart of our world within the posture that erases the separation between  internal and external. 

Then we will explore the basic concepts and protocols that Valerie has received from zen tradition and actualised for non-monastic communities.

After this, there will be 2 weeks to explore how we could cook our life to better nourish the world and have joy doing so  together. During this residency we will swim in the dordogne and paddle, explore plum village, and visit the worldly renowned prehistoric caves of the region, while also getting the necessary time to work. 

Potential dates TBC: June 11th - July 2nd 

Valerie will organize this residency if a minimum of 7 people express their desire  for this Food Praxis teaching. Please send your interest via the general praxis hub form and Valerie will contact you quickly.
